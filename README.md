# Hi Lo Game

# This game first chooses a random card from the deck. Then the player will guess if the next card will be higher or lower than the original card. If the player is correct they are awarded 100 points and if the player is incorrect then they lose 75 points. The player can chose to continue or stop the game after each round.
